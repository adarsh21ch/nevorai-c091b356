              Nevorai is a complete video sharing platform built for Indian business owners — coaches, network marketers, insurance agents, real estate agents, course creators and online entrepreneurs. If you've been using YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive to share sales videos with your prospects, you're losing leads every day. YouTube shows your competitors' videos in the sidebar. Vimeo costs ₹10,000+ a month. Google Drive has no tracking. Nevorai solves all three problems in one tool.
